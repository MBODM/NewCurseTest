# NewCurseTest
Sample code to test handling of new Curse site

Curse (https://www.curseforge.com) completely re-designed and re-developed their web sites, on the 18th of April in 2023. Including the site for World of Warcraft addons, of course. This means i had to adjust my own development stuff accordingly, in tools like WADH or WADM.

Before i can implement all the new Curse handling stuff into those tools (for the peoples that using them), i need some test project. Therefore i quickly created this repo.

Project parameters:
- C# and .NET 7
- WebView2 (from NuGet package)
- WinForms (as UI tech for rapid development)
- Developed with Visual Studio 2022 v17.5.4
